# slack-scheduler-bot

What are we building?

A slackbot that can schedule meetings for you and your team. 

Who is our immediate customer? 

Teams who use Slack and actively schedule meetings on Google Calendar. 

Why are we building this now? 

Productivity is hard to come by in fast-paced work environments. Dozens of browsers tabs, desktop apps,  and mobile notifications drown your ability to focus and concentrate. As companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and IBM continue to build powerful AI-based platforms and tools, the barrier to applying machine learning to real user problems is becoming dramatically reduced. 

Scheduler Bot solves a real customer problem by streamlining workflow for a very large, immediately addressable market (teams who schedules meetings and use Slack) at the exact right time (advent of new powerful, easy-to-use AI technologies + proliferation of software tools used on job)

Technologies used: API.AI, Slack API, Google Calendar API.
